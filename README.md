# Statement
Welcome to use this simulator!   
This simulator is aimed to provide a user-friendly GUI for people who do not have strong battery or computer knowledge.To use this simulator, you must install OpenFOAM6 and ParaView5.4.0 on your computer as well.  
You can get the simulator and whole codes on <a href="https://github.com/KinomotoTomoyo/BatterySimulator">this address</a>. This simulator is under GPLv3 which means you can use it for free. However, you **cannot** use it for any commercial purpose.  
The *BatterySimulator* folder contains two subfolders, *GUI* and *SourceCode*. If you want to use the simulator, just ignore *SourceCode* folder.  
The simulator is tested under ubuntu-18.04.6 environment, please ensure your system environment is higher than this one(ubuntu-20 is also acceptable).

# Installation Guide
1. Use `git clone` command to get the *BatterySimulator* folder or download the .zip file directly.
2. You should get a folder called *BatterySimulator-main*. Open terminal and input command `sudo chmod -R 777 BatterySimulator-main`.
3. Make sure OpenFOAM6 and ParaView5.4.0 are already installed on your computer correctly. If not, follow the steps on <a href="https://openfoam.org/download/6-ubuntu/">official site</a>.
4. Make sure `make` module is installed on your computer correctly. If not, install it by command `sudo apt-get install make`.
5. Find the file */opt/openfoam6/etc/controlDict* and open it. Find the line `dimensionSet 1;`(You can use `ctrl+f` to locate), then change `1` to `0` and save it.
6. Open terminal under *GUI* folder and input `./BatterySimulator`, then you can use the simulator.

# User guide
To use this simulator is very simple, you only need to follow the hints on the interfaces and start to create your own projects!  
There are only a few things that need a bit more explanation:
1. If you are the first time to run a project, you **must** click **Modify* button on Geometry interface at least once even if you do not change parameters on this interface.
2. The GUI embeds the linux terminal function. You don't need to input any command during the process, however, if you want to execute any command, you can do it.
3. You can view your geometry through *View Geometry* once you clicked **Modify* button on Geometry interface(This means related geometry files will be generated). This will open ParaView and later operations will be perforamed through ParaView instead of BatterySimulator.
4. Once you generated related results files through *Run/Resume* button on Control interface, you can click *View Results*. This will open a new interface, and you can view kinds of graphs intuitively.
